# Validate Color

> ‚úÖüåàüôå Validate HTML colors by `name`, `special name`, `hex`, `rgb`, `rgba`, `hsl`, `hsla`, `hwb`, `lab` or `lch` values

**_HTML colors are remarkably easy to get wrong_**, because they allow for so many different values.

As I was writing [Console Log Plus](https://github.com/dreamyguy/console-log-plus), I thought it would be great to allow users to pass any _HTML color_ they wanted as one of the parameter to the function. But since _HTML colors_ have so many variations and therefore are complex strings, it didn't take me long to realize that I'd have to make quite a few checks to validate the value passed by the user. That need brought me here.

**Validate Color** let's one validate the color string against all current possible _HTML color_ values. Some examples:

- `hex` - `#bada55`
- `name` - `LightGoldenrodYellow`
- `special name` - `currentColor`
- `rgb` - `rgb(0 0 0)`
- `rgba` - `rgba(0, 0, 0, .45)`
- `hsl` - `hsl(4.71239rad, 60%, 70%)`
- `hsla` - `hsla(180deg 100% 50% / .8)`
- `hwb` - `hwb(180deg 0% 0% / 100%)`
- `lab` - `lab(2000.1337% -8.6911 -159.131231 / .987189732)`
- `lch` - `lch(54.292% 106.839 40.853)`

Both `rgba` and `hsla` are now officially merged into their `rgb` and `hsl` counterparts, so the `a` can be omitted. The `a` is considered legacy syntax, so it will still work.

# Demo ‚úÖ üåà üôå

To demonstrate the power of _validate-color_, I decided it would be best to create a living github page, that would serve both as a way of showcase _validate-color_, and facilitate its use:

[https://dreamyguy.github.io/validate-color/][7]

On this page you can:

- **Validate HTML colors as you type**

_On my TODO list:_

- _See opaque colors against black and white backgrounds._
- _See colors with transparency in different contexts._

# Usage

**validate-color** is also [available as a package on `npm`][6] and can be installed as a depedency with:

    npm i validate-color --save

As with any node module, first you'll have to import it with `require`:

```javascript
var validateColor = require("validate-color").default;
```

...or through `import`:

```javascript
import validateColor from "validate-color";
```

Once you've done the import, you'll be able to do checks like (example in **React**):

```javascript
import React from "react";
import validateColor from "validate-color";

const ColorBox = (props) => {
  const { color = "", text = "" } = props;
  const theColor = color && validateColor(color) ? color : "transparent";
  return (
    <div className="color-box" style={{ backgroundColor: theColor }}>
      <p>{text}</p>
    </div>
  );
};

export default ColorBox;
```

> üëâ The source for a full-fledged color validation component can be [viewed here](https://github.com/dreamyguy/validate-color/blob/master/src/app/App.js). That component can be [seen in action here][7].

# Extend

One can "extend" the library by using only parts of it.

**1. Validate only HTML colors (`hex`, `rgb`, `rgba`, `hsl`, `hsla`, `hwb`, `lab`, `lch`), without `name`**

```javascript
import { validateHTMLColor } from "validate-color";
```

**2. Validate only `HEX` colors**

```javascript
import { validateHTMLColorHex } from "validate-color";
```

**3. Validate only `HSL` colors**

```javascript
import { validateHTMLColorHsl } from "validate-color";
```

**4. Validate only `NAME` colors**

```javascript
import { validateHTMLColorName } from "validate-color";
```

**5. Validate only `RGB` colors**

```javascript
import { validateHTMLColorRgb } from "validate-color";
```

**6. Validate only `SPECIAL NAME` colors**

```javascript
import { validateHTMLColorSpecialName } from "validate-color";
```

**7. Validate only `HWB` colors**

```javascript
import { validateHTMLColorHwb } from "validate-color";
```

**8. Validate only `LAB` colors**

```javascript
import { validateHTMLColorLab } from "validate-color";
```

**9. Validate only `LCH` colors**

```javascript
import { validateHTMLColorLch } from "validate-color";
```

> üëâ I was proactive and added validation to these relatively new HTML/CSS colors (**HWB** & **LAB** & **LCH**), but since [they're still drafts at the time of this writing][9], they might still be not fully supported at the time of this reading.

# Preventing ReDoS (`regex` denial-of-service) attacks

A ReDoS vulnerability [was reported as an issue](https://github.com/dreamyguy/validate-color/issues/28) on Oct 14, 2022, but that went under my radar. It was just today (Jan 29, 2023) I came across the issue, and luckily I had time to look into it.

This vulnerability was officially reported as **`CVE-2021-40892`**, and is listed a few places: [1](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-40892), [2](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-40892), [3](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-VALIDATECOLOR-2935878), [4](https://cve.report/CVE-2021-40892), [5](https://feedly.com/cve/CVE-2021-40892).

A similar problem was reported for the [`color-string` package](https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-COLORSTRING-1082939), versions < 1.5.5.

A good article by Godson Obielum: [How to protect against regex denial-of-service (ReDoS) attacks](https://blog.logrocket.com/protect-against-regex-denial-of-service-redos-attacks/).

The issue is caused by the "greedy" character in `regex`, the infamous `+`. I've made amendments that limit the number of both spaces and digits by `5`, instead of having no limits.

I've also made patterns stricter and removed redundant optionals, simplifying whenever possible.

> üëâ All current `regex` have been tested with https://regex.rip/ and `npx redos-detector check "<regex pattern>" --maxSteps 10000)` (see [redos-detector](https://www.npmjs.com/package/redos-detector) for more options).

**That will, from this point onwards, invalidate otherwise valid colors that cross that threshold.**

Since this is an important update, I'm releasing it as a patch ([`v2.2.3`](https://github.com/dreamyguy/validate-color/releases/tag/v2.2.3))

# Development

## Getting started

Clone this repo locally. You'll need to have [NodeJS][1] installed. Install all dependencies by running:

    npm i

## Run it locally

To start the app locally, run:

    npm run start

This command fires up the application on port `9900`, making it visible on http://localhost:9900. Because this app is based on [create-react-app][2], the port number should be configured on the [.env](https://github.com/dreamyguy/validate-color/blob/master/.env#L1) file.

## Building the frontend for Production

When you're ready to build for production, run:

     npm run build

This command compiles all production-optimised resources to a folder called **build**. It's meant to be run remotely, at the environment host, at build time.

## Building for NPM

When you're done with your changes, run:

     npm run build-npm

This command compiles the distribution-optimised `javascript` to `lib/index.js`, a file compiled out of [src/validate-color/index.js][3].

> üëâ Note that the `lib/` folder and its contents are only available at the [NPM distribution][6].

# Testing

This project wouldn't be complete without proper testing.

[Jest][4] is my Unit Testing framework of choice. It's well documented and shares good practices & syntax with its most known predecessors (Mocha, Jasmine, etc). [Babel][5] was introduced as a dependency to the project because of Jest, but it was worth it since now we can use **ES6** syntax on our tests as well.

Run all tests, in watch mode:

    npm run test

Tests are also run through [Travis][8] on every push to `master`. The build status is shown [at the top of this README](https://github.com/dreamyguy/validate-color#validate-color).

> üëâ All tests are named according to the file they're testing: `index.js` -> _`index.test.js`_, and reside under the same directory. Since `Jest` comes as courtesy of [CRA][2], all tests should be placed under the [src/](https://github.com/dreamyguy/validate-color/blob/master/src/) folder.

# Deploying

This repo is a hybrid one. It:

- Builds the NPM distribution
- Builds the GitHub Page that serves as a demo/showcase

There are 3 commands one can run to deploy to these two places.

**Deploy to GitHub Pages**

    npm run deploy

**Deploy to NPM**

    npm run deploy-npm

**Deploy to both places at once**

    npm run release

> ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure to bump version before releasing!
