Vue integration for **[Nano Stores]**, a tiny state manager
with many atomic tree-shakable stores.

* **Small.** Less than 1 KB with all helpers. Zero dependencies.
* **Fast.** With small atomic and derived stores, you do not need to call
  the selector function for all components on every store change.
* **Tree Shakable.** The chunk contains only stores used by components
  in the chunk.
* **Helpers.** Designed to keep code clean and save a few keystrokes.
* **Devtools.** Plugin with full support of [Vue Devtools].
* Was designed to move logic from components to stores.
* It has good **TypeScript** support.
