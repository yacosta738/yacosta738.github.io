## Why this post?

Angular is one of the most highly recommended frontend frameworks in the software industry. However, if you want to create a full-stack web-application, it only covers half of the requirements. For a while now, I've been pairing it with [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) and it's been working really well in multiple projects.

I keep recommending this combination to friends and coworkers, so I wanted to finally write down the setup I use as a reference/starting point. Maybe this post inspires you to also give it a try. If so, please let me know how it worked for you.

[Angular](https://angular.io/) will be our frontend-framework for this example, we will use [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) for our backend, and all of this will function as a whole inside [Nx](https://nx.dev/) workspace. We will introduce a few quality-of-life improvements as well as bundle both projects up into one single package.

[NestJS](https://nestjs.com/) is an abstraction layer that sits on top of [Express](https://expressjs.com/es/) or [Fastify](https://www.fastify.io/), both NodeJS-powered REST-frameworks. It is written in Typescript and follows a lot of the same patterns found in Angular (annotations, DI, etc.). Nx is a set of tools developed by ex-Googlers which help develop in Monorepos. They also offer pretty sensible default choices and configuration overrides.

You ready? Let's go!

# Scaffolding

First, we'll setup a new Nx workspace and create an Angular and NestJS application inside it:

```shell
‚ùØ npx create-nx-workspace@latest
‚úî Workspace name (e.g., org name)     ¬∑ hn-feed
‚úî What to create in the new workspace ¬∑ angular-nest
‚úî Application name                    ¬∑ client
‚úî Default stylesheet format           ¬∑ css
‚úî Use Nx Cloud? (It's free and doesn't require registration.) ¬∑ No
```

When finished, this will have done the following:

1. create a new directory with the workspace name
2. generate a fresh Angular project located under `apps/client`
3. create a new NestJS project located under `apps/api`
4. generate a sample typescript library inside the workspace - to be used by both client and api (located under `libs/api-interfaces`)

What's also neat is that Nx comes with improved tooling for both projects, such as:

- using Jest over Karma as a unit-test runner
- using Cypress over Protractor for E2E specs (Angular only)
- using Prettier to format the code automatically
- decent TSLint settings for the whole workspace

There's [tons more features](https://nx.dev/angular/getting-started/why-nx#10-minute-nx-overview) offered by Nx, but those are the ones I wanted to point out right now.

# Running the projects

Now that we have the basic projects set up, it's time to boot them up. Open 2 Terminal windows and run the following commands:

```shell
`[Terminal 1]: npm run nx -- serve client `

`[Terminal 2]: npm run nx -- serve api`
```

The first command will run the default Angular dev-server, compile and serve the frontend under [](http://localhost:4200/)<http://localhost:4200>. The second will start the NestJS dev-server, compile the Typescript down to NodeJS-compatible JavaScript and serve the result under [](http://localhost:3333/api)<http://localhost:3333/api>. As a nice bonus, Nx has added a proxy configuration for the Angular dev-server, which will proxy requests to [](http://localhost:4200/api)<http://localhost:4200/api> to the NestJS dev-server for us, so that we don't run into any CORS issues while developing. The proxy config can be found under `apps/client/proxy.conf.json` and it's referenced inside the `angular.json` project definition file.

If you open now your browser on [](http://localhost:4200/)<http://localhost:4200>, you should see a page similar to this one:

![localhost:4200](/uploads/localhost.webp 'App running in localhost')

If you inspect the network and refresh, you'll see an XHR request to [](http://localhost:4200/api/hello)<http://localhost:4200/api/hello> showing that the proxy has been set up properly.

## Wait, what?

Let me explain what's going on:

The NestJS project was configured with a prefix to use for all controllers. This prefix was defined as follows under (`apps/api/src/main.ts`)

```typescript
const globalPrefix = 'api'
app.setGlobalPrefix(globalPrefix)
```

Nx also generated a sample REST-controller, called AppController (`apps/api/src/app/app.controller.ts`) that currently serves a static chunk of data, in our case an object of the Typescript interface `Message` defined like this (`libs/api-interfaces/src/lib/api-interfaces.ts`):

```typescript
export interface Message {
  message: string
}
```

Because the interface `Message` is defined in the shared library, it can be used both by frontend and backend. Sweet, type-safety across both projects!

The AppController method is annotated with

```typescript
 @Get('hello')
  getData(): Message {
    return this.appService.getData();
  }
```

which tells NestJS to expose a new GET-endpoint under [](http://localhost:3333/api/hello)<http://localhost:3333/api/hello> and return our message object, when the server is running.

On the other end of the stack we have the Angular project, which was configured to do a sample GET request to this exact endpoint. The sample code can be found in the AppComponent of the frontend under `apps/client/src/app/app.component.ts`

```typescript
export class AppComponent {
  hello$ = this.http.get<Message>('/api/hello')
  constructor(private http: HttpClient) {}
}
```

and it's invoked using the async pipe directly in the template:

```html
<div>Message: {{ hello$ | async | json }}</div>
```

Now, since the Angular dev-server is running on [](http://localhost:4200/)<http://localhost:4200>, the request will go to [](http://localhost/4200/api/hello)<http://localhost/4200/api/hello> due to the relative path in the `httpClient` call. This gets picked up by the Angular proxy config and is forwarded to our NestJS server. Awesome üéâ

# Tweaking the application for development

Congratulations, we now have a workspace with both NestJS and Angular running beside each other as well as sample code on how to call the backend from the frontend. That's already pretty neat!

What I like to do in order to make for a better development experience, is starting both frontend and backend dev-server in parallel, with a single command. For this we will install a node-helper called [concurrently](https://www.npmjs.com/package/concurrently).

```shell
npm install --save-dev concurrently
```

Once that's done, we can adapt the `package.json` as follows:

```shell
"start:fe": "ng serve client",
"start:be": "ng serve api",
"dev": "concurrently -p=\"{name}\" -n=\"Angular,NestJS\" -c=\"green,blue\" \"npm run start:fe\" \"npm run start:be\"",
```

Now running `npm run dev` will start both dev-servers in parallel, prefix each line to the Terminal with either "Angular" or "NestJS" and color the prefixes in green and blue. Awesome!

# Serving frontend and backend from a single server for production

Okay, now we have a full-stack application ready for development. Let's finalise it by packaging our app as a single executable npm package that will serve both our frontend and backend.

To achieve this we will create a production build of our Angular application and configure our NestJS server to serve the frontend under its root path, so that we can bundle both in a self-contained package (to deploy it e.g. to CloudFoundry or some other cloud provider).

First, we'll create a production build of the Angular frontend:

```shell
>  npm run nx -- build client --prod

> hn-feed@0.0.0 nx /Users/acosta/Projects/hn-feed
> nx "build" "client" "--prod"


> ng run client:build:production
Generating ES5 bundles for differential loading...
ES5 bundle generation complete.

// ... A few seconds later...

Date: 2020-06-17T16:14:41.427Z - Hash: 4957569a994e1b83d273 - Time: 34832ms
```

Now our frontends compiled (minified, uglified, polyfilled) output can be found under `dist/apps/client`

Let's configure NestJS to serve this folder when we access its root path.

First, we'll install the NestJS `serve-static` package to allow serving of static assets

```shell
npm install --save @nestjs/serve-static
```

Now all we need to do is import and configure the `ServeStaticModule` provided by this package inside the AppModule (`apps/api/src/app/app.module.ts`)

```typescript
import { ServeStaticModule } from '@nestjs/serve-static'
import { join } from 'path'

// ...

@Module({
  imports: [
    ServeStaticModule.forRoot({
      rootPath: join(__dirname, '..', 'client')
    })
  ]
  // ...
})
export class AppModule {}
```

which instructs NestJS to traverse into `../client` from its own dist-folder (`dist/apps/api`) and serve the contents on its root path.

And sure enough, running only the backend via `npm run start:be` and navigating to [](http://localhost:3333/)<http://localhost:3333/> should yield the same result as before, when we ran the Angular dev-server:

# Packaging the application for deployment

All that's left now is to bundle everything in an `npm` package and we'll be ready to deploy our full-stack application. Let's do that now.

We need to edit the `package.json` to only include the dist-files and as a convenience we'll add a start-script:

```json
{
    ...
    "files": ["dist/apps/client", "dist/apps/api"],
    ...
    scripts: {
    "serve": "node dist/apps/api/main.js",
    ...
    }
}
```

Now, if we run `npm pack`, a tarball file will be generated for us in the project directory:

```shell
npm pack
npm notice
npm notice üì¶  hn-feed@0.0.0
npm notice === Tarball Contents ===
// ...
npm notice === Tarball Details ===
npm notice name:          hn-feed
npm notice version:       0.0.0
npm notice filename:      hn-feed-0.0.0.tgz
npm notice total files:   14
```

We can now upload this package to our favorite cloud provider, have it run `npm install --production` after the upload and provide the `serve` script as a startup command for the package (this step varies depending on your cloud provider).

Of course you can also run this package locally, by simply unpacking the tarball file, running `npm install --production` inside the directory, then running `npm run serve`.

I hope you found this post helpful. Let me know if you're missing any important steps! There's obviously a lot more we can do now that we have this setup, like runtime type validation for our frontend or backend, sharing logic across frontend and backend by using a shared library in the same workspace, etc. If you're interested in those topics, I'll gladly write a follow-up post to this one :)

Thanks for reading!
