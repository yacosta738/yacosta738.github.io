title: Singleton pattern
description: The Singleton pattern restricts a class's instantiation to one
  object, providing benefits such as global state, configuration settings, and
  simplified testing. It enforces a single point of access for the instance of
  the class and reduces the amount of code needed to maintain a single instance
  of an object.

![Singleton pattern](/uploads/singleton-pattern.webp 'Singleton pattern')

The Singleton pattern is a software design pattern that restricts the instantiation of a class to one object. It is a useful technique when only a single instance of a class is required, such as for a configuration manager or for a logging class. This pattern is also useful for limiting the resources that are consumed by an application.

The primary benefit of the Singleton pattern is that it allows for a single instance to be shared among different parts of an application. This can make implementing things like global state or configuration settings easier. It also reduces the amount of code needed to maintain a single instance of an object.

The Singleton pattern also enforces a single point of access for the instance of the class. This can make it easier to handle requests for the instance, as well as providing a consistent interface for interacting with the instance.

Finally, the Singleton pattern can be used to simplify testing, as a single instance of the object can be used in multiple tests. This can make it easier to ensure that the tests are consistent and that the application behaves as expected.

In conclusion, the Singleton pattern is a useful technique for implementing a single instance of a class. It can reduce the amount of code needed to maintain the instance, as well as providing a consistent interface for interacting with it. Additionally, it can simplify testing by providing a single instance to use in multiple tests.
