## **Description**

This tutorial explains how to run software on Windows without requiring administrator privileges by using a simple Bash script. This method is useful when you want to avoid User Account Control (UAC) prompts or when you lack elevated permissions.

⚠️ **Warning:**

This method should be used responsibly. It is not recommended for running software from untrusted sources, as it can compromise your system's security.

## **Implementation Steps**

1. **Create a Script File:**
Open your preferred text editor (Notepad, Notepad++, VSCode).
2. **Write the Following Content:**Set_COMPAT_LAYER=RunAsInvoker
Start SteamSetup.exe

    - `Set_COMPAT_LAYER=RunAsInvoker`: Tells Windows to run the program without elevating privileges.
    - `Start SteamSetup.exe`: Launches the Steam installer (you can replace it with any executable).

3. **Save the File:**

    - **Extension:** `.bat` or `.cmd` (Example: `bypass-admin.bat`)
    - **Location:** Save it in an easily accessible folder.

4. **Run the Script:**

    - Double-click the `.bat` file to execute the program without administrator permission prompts.

## **Practical Applications**

- Run installers that usually require elevated permissions.
- Test software without changing system settings.
- Avoid UAC prompts for trusted programs.

## **Additional Notes**

- Not all programs can be run using this method, especially those requiring access to protected system resources.
- You can create shortcuts to the script for process automation.

✅ **Status:**

- **Tested on:** Windows 10, Windows 11
- **Compatibility:** Works with most programs that don't need access to critical resources.
