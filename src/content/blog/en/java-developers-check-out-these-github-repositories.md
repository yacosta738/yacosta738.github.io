![Java Developers: Check Out These GitHub Repositories!](/images/java-developers-check-out-these-github-repositories-.png 'Java Developers: Check Out These GitHub Repositories!')

Java is beloved for its robust community and its wide range of available resources. To illustrate this point, I'm listing some of my favorite Java repositories on GitHub. These are repositories I use regularly, and I hope you find them as useful as I do.

## Awesome java

An extensive compilation of impressive frameworks, libraries, and software related to Java programming has been thoughtfully curated for your convenience.

## Modern Java - A Guide to Java 8

This guide provides an overview of one of the most disruptive and innovative Java versions: [Java 8](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/javase8-archive-downloads.html).

We will explore the language features step by step with short, simple code samples. We will learn how to use default interface methods, lambda expressions, method references, and repeatable annotations.

At the end of this tutorial, you will be familiar with the most recent [API](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/) changes such as streams, functional interfaces, map extensions, and the new Date API.

## Java Design Patterns

This site showcases Java Design Patterns developed by experienced programmers and architects from the open-source community. Patterns can be browsed either by their high-level descriptions or by their source code. Source code examples are well commented on and can act as tutorials on how to implement the pattern. Popular battle-proven open-source Java technologies are used.

## Spring Framework

The Spring Framework is the foundation of the entire Spring family of projects, available for download at [spring.io/projects](https://spring.io/projects). This includes a wide range of different projects, all of which are collectively referred to as "Spring". With this single framework, developers can access a vast array of tools, libraries, and components for building modern, feature-rich applications. The Spring Framework is designed to be highly extensible and customizable, making it an ideal choice for developing complex applications.

## Algorithms

Open-source resources are available to help learn data structures and algorithms, and how to implement them in Java. These implementations are intended for educational purposes and may be less efficient than the Java standard library. While there are many tools available to help you learn and stay up to date with the latest developments in the Java language, these resources can often be difficult to find.

## RxJava

Reactive Extensions for the JVM is a library that allows you to create asynchronous and event-based programs using observable sequences for the Java Virtual Machine.

## Baeldung Java and Spring Tutorials

This project comprises of concise tutorials that cover a single, well-defined area of development in the Java ecosystem. These tutorials have a strong focus on the Spring Framework - including Spring, Spring Boot, and Spring Security. In addition to Spring, the modules here also cover various aspects of Java.

## Google Style Guides

This project contains style guides for major languages used by Google, such as Java [link](https://google.github.io/styleguide/javaguide.html).

[https://github.com/google/styleguide](https://github.com/google/styleguide)

The **[Google Java Format](https://github.com/google/google-java-format)** is a tool to help enforce the style guide for your projects.
