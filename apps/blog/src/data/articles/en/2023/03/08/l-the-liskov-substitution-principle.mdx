The Liskov substitution principle (LSP) is the third principle of the SOLID design principles. It states that subtypes should be substitutable for their base types. Specifically, objects of a superclass should be able to be replaced with objects of a subclass without altering the correctness of the program. This principle helps to ensure that objects of a subclass can be used interchangeably with objects of the superclass, without introducing any unexpected behavior.

An example of a bad practice that violates the Liskov Substitution Principle (LSP) is a class hierarchy where a subclass overrides a method in a way that changes the method's contract.

```kotlin
open class Rectangle {
    open var width: Int = 0
    open var height: Int = 0
    open fun area(): Int {
        return width * height
    }
}

class Square : Rectangle() {
    override var width: Int
        get() = super.width
        set(value) {
            super.width = value
            super.height = value
        }
    override var height: Int
        get() = super.height
        set(value) {
            super.width = value
            super.height = value
        }
}
```

In this example, the **Square** class is a subclass of the **Rectangle** class. However, the **Square** class overrides the **width** and **height** properties in a way that changes the class's contract. Specifically, the **Square** class sets both the **width** and **height** properties to the same value, ensuring that a square is always a square. Nevertheless, this is not an actual square, since a square is a rectangle with equal width and height values. As a result, replacing an object of the Rectangle class with an object of the Square class may result in unexpected program behavior.

A better practice would be to create a new class **Square** that has its own properties and methods, while also extending the **Rectangle** class.

```kotlin
open class Rectangle {
    open var width: Int = 0
    open var height: Int = 0
    open fun area(): Int {
        return width * height
    }
}

class Square : Rectangle() {
    var side: Int = 0
    override var width: Int
        get() = side
        set(value) {
            side = value
        }
    override var height: Int
        get() = side
        set(value) {
            side = value
        }
    override fun area(): Int {
        return side * side
    }
}
```

In conclusion, the **Square** class has its own properties and methods, making it interchangeable with the **Rectangle** class without introducing unexpected behavior. This adherence to the Liskov Substitution Principle results in code that is more maintainable and predictable.
