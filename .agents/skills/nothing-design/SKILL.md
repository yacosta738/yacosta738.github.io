# Nothing-Inspired UI/UX Design System

A senior product designer's toolkit trained in Swiss typography, industrial design (Braun, Teenage
Engineering), and modern interface craft. Monochromatic, typographically driven, information-dense
without clutter. Dark and light mode with equal rigor.

**Before starting any design work, declare which Google Fonts are required and how to load them** (
see `references/tokens.md` Section 1). Never assume fonts are already available.

This skill is for **intentional Nothing-inspired execution**, not loose minimalism. Apply it when
the user explicitly asks for Nothing design language or invokes `/nothing-design`.

## 1. DESIGN PHILOSOPHY

- **Subtract, don't add.** Every element must earn its pixel. Default to removal.
- **Structure is ornament.** Expose the grid, the data, the hierarchy itself.
- **Monochrome is the canvas.** Color is an event, not a default — except when encoding data
  status (see Section 3).
- **Type does the heavy lifting.** Scale, weight, and spacing create hierarchy — not color, not
  icons, not borders.
- **Both modes are first-class.** Dark mode: OLED black. Light mode: warm off-white. Neither is "
  derived" — both get full design attention. Ask the user which mode to start with.
- **Industrial warmth.** Technical and precise, but never cold. A human hand should be felt.

## 2. CRAFT RULES — HOW TO COMPOSE

### 2.1 Visual Hierarchy: The Three-Layer Rule

Every screen has exactly **three layers of importance.** Not two, not five. Three.

| Layer         | What                                                              | How                                                                                                        |
|---------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Primary**   | The ONE thing the user sees first. A number, a headline, a state. | Doto or Space Grotesk at display size. `--text-display`. 48–96px breathing room.                           |
| **Secondary** | Supporting context. Labels, descriptions, related data.           | Space Grotesk at body/subheading. `--text-primary`. Grouped tight (8–16px) to the primary.                 |
| **Tertiary**  | Metadata, navigation, system info. Visible but never competing.   | Space Mono at caption/label. `--text-secondary` or `--text-disabled`. ALL CAPS. Pushed to edges or bottom. |

**The test:** Squint at the screen. Can you still tell what's most important? If two things compete,
one needs to shrink, fade, or move.

**Common mistake:** Making everything "secondary." Evenly-sized elements with even spacing = visual
flatness. Be brave — make the primary absurdly large and the tertiary absurdly small. The contrast
IS the hierarchy.

### 2.2 Font Discipline

Per screen, use maximum:

- **2 font families** (Space Grotesk + Space Mono. Doto only for hero moments.)
- **3 font sizes** (one large, one medium, one small)
- **2 font weights** (Regular + one other — usually Light or Medium, rarely Bold)

Think of it as a budget. Every additional size/weight costs visual coherence. Before adding a new
size, ask: can I create this distinction with spacing or color instead?

| Decision                  | Size |  Weight  | Color |
|---------------------------|:----:|:--------:|:-----:|
| Heading vs. body          | Yes  |    No    |  No   |
| Label vs. value           |  No  |    No    |  Yes  |
| Active vs. inactive nav   |  No  |    No    |  Yes  |
| Hero number vs. unit      | Yes  |    No    |  No   |
| Section title vs. content | Yes  | Optional |  No   |

**Rule of thumb:** If reaching for a new font-size, it's probably a spacing problem. Add distance
instead.

### 2.3 Spacing as Meaning

Spacing is the primary tool for communicating relationships.

```text
Tight (4–8px)   = "These belong together" (icon + label, number + unit)
Medium (16px)    = "Same group, different items" (list items, form fields)
Wide (32–48px)   = "New group starts here" (section breaks)
Vast (64–96px)   = "This is a new context" (hero to content, major divisions)
```

**If a divider line is needed, the spacing is probably wrong.** Dividers are a symptom of
insufficient spacing contrast. Use them only in data-dense lists where items are structurally
identical.

### 2.4 Container Strategy (prefer top)

1. **Spacing alone** (proximity groups items)
2. A single divider line
3. A subtle border outline
4. A surface card with background change

Each step down adds visual weight. Use the lightest tool that works. Never box the most important
element — let it float on the background.

### 2.5 Color as Hierarchy

In a monochrome system, the gray scale IS the hierarchy. Max 4 levels per screen:

```text
--text-display (100%) → Hero numbers. One per screen.
--text-primary (90%)  → Body text, primary content.
--text-secondary (60%) → Labels, captions, metadata.
--text-disabled (40%) → Disabled, timestamps, hints.
```

**Red (#D71921) is not part of the hierarchy.** It's an interrupt — "look HERE, NOW." If nothing is
urgent, no red on the screen.

**Data status colors** (success green, warning amber, accent red) are exempt from the "one accent"
rule when encoding data values. Apply color to the **value itself**, not labels or row backgrounds.
See `references/tokens.md` for the full color system.

### 2.6 Consistency vs. Variance

**Be consistent in:** Font families, label treatment (always Space Mono ALL CAPS), spacing rhythm,
color roles, component shapes, alignment.

**Break the pattern in exactly ONE place per screen:** An oversized number, a circular widget among
rectangles, a red accent among grays, a Doto headline, a vast gap where everything else is tight.

This single break IS the design. Without it: sterile grid. With more than one: visual chaos.

### 2.7 Compositional Balance

**Asymmetry > symmetry.** Centered layouts feel generic. Favor deliberately unbalanced composition:

- **Large left, small right:** Hero metric + metadata stack.
- **Top-heavy:** Big headline near top, sparse content below.
- **Edge-anchored:** Important elements pinned to screen edges, negative space in center.

Balance heavy elements with more empty space, not with more heavy elements.

### 2.8 The Nothing Vibe

1. **Confidence through emptiness.** Large uninterrupted background areas. Resist filling space.
2. **Precision in the small things.** Letter-spacing, exact gray values, 4px gaps. Micro-decisions
   compound into craft.
3. **Data as beauty.** `36GB/s` in Space Mono at 48px IS the visual. No illustrations needed.
4. **Mechanical honesty.** Controls look like controls. A toggle = physical switch. A gauge =
   instrument.
5. **One moment of surprise.** A dot-matrix headline. A circular widget. A red dot. Restraint makes
   the one expressive moment powerful.
6. **Percussive, not fluid.** Imagine UI sounds: click not swoosh, tick not chime. Design
   transitions that feel mechanical and precise.

### 2.9 Visual Variety in Data-Dense Screens

When 3+ data sections appear on one screen, vary the visual form:

| Form                                | Best for                     | Weight           |
|-------------------------------------|------------------------------|------------------|
| Hero number (large Doto/Space Mono) | Single key metric            | Heavy — use once |
| Segmented progress bar              | Progress toward goal         | Medium           |
| Concentric rings / arcs             | Multiple related percentages | Medium           |
| Inline compact bar                  | Secondary metrics in rows    | Light            |
| Number-only with status color       | Values without proportion    | Lightest         |
| Sparkline                           | Trends over time             | Medium           |
| Stat row (label + value)            | Simple data points           | Light            |

Lead section → heaviest treatment. Secondary → different form. Tertiary → lightest. The FORM varies,
the VOICE stays the same.

## 3. ANTI-PATTERNS — WHAT TO NEVER DO

- No gradients in UI chrome
- No shadows. No blur. Flat surfaces, border separation.
- No skeleton loading screens. Use `[LOADING...]` text or segmented spinner.
- No toast popups. Use inline status text: `[SAVED]`, `[ERROR: ...]`
- No sad-face illustrations, cute mascots, or multi-paragraph empty states
- No zebra striping in tables
- No filled icons, multi-color icons, or emoji as UI
- No parallax, scroll-jacking, or gratuitous animation
- No spring/bounce easing. Use subtle ease-out only.
- No border-radius > 16px on cards. Buttons are pill (999px) or technical (4–8px).
- Data visualization: differentiate with **opacity** (100%/60%/30%) or **pattern** (
  solid/striped/dotted) before introducing color.

---

## 4. WORKFLOW

1. **Declare fonts** — tell the user which Google Fonts to load (see `references/tokens.md`)
2. **Confirm mode** — ask whether to start in dark or light mode if the user did not already specify
   it. Neither is default.
3. **Sketch hierarchy** — identify the 3 layers before writing any code
4. **Choose platform output** — HTML/CSS, React/Tailwind, SwiftUI, or design-tool language
5. **Compose** — apply craft rules (Sections 2.1–2.9)
6. **Check tokens** — consult `references/tokens.md` for exact values
7. **Build components** — consult `references/components.md` for patterns
8. **Adapt to platform** — consult `references/platform-mapping.md` for output conventions

---

## 5. REQUIRED RESPONSE CONTRACT

When this skill is used for any design or implementation request, structure the response in this
order:

1. **Fonts required**
    - List exact Google Fonts needed
    - Show how to load them (`<link>` / `@import` / package import)
2. **Mode**
    - State whether the solution starts with dark or light mode
    - If unspecified, stop and ask before producing final UI code
3. **Three-layer hierarchy**
    - Primary
    - Secondary
    - Tertiary
4. **Layout strategy**
    - Main composition pattern
    - Spacing rhythm
    - Where the single expressive break appears
5. **Component mapping**
    - Which components/patterns are being used
    - Why they fit the hierarchy
6. **Token mapping**
    - Relevant typography, color, spacing, radius, and motion tokens
7. **Final output**
    - Design guidance, implementation code, or both depending on the user request

Do not jump straight into code without covering items 1 to 4 first.

---

## 6. ACCESSIBILITY BASELINE

Nothing-inspired does **not** mean inaccessible. Preserve the visual language while meeting these
minimums:

- Maintain readable contrast for all text and interactive states; do not use `--text-disabled` for
  essential content
- Every interactive element needs a visible focus state; prefer border, underline, or inversion
  rather than glow/shadow
- Respect minimum touch target size of 44x44px for controls
- Provide reduced-motion-friendly behavior; if animation is used, keep it subtle and removable
- Use semantic labels and accessible names for icon-only buttons, toggles, segmented controls, and
  data widgets
- Do not communicate status with color alone; pair color with text, value, icon, pattern, or label

If a strict visual rule conflicts with accessibility, accessibility wins while staying as close as
possible to the Nothing aesthetic.

---

## 7. PERMITTED ADAPTATIONS

These rules keep the style strong without making the skill brittle:

- **No shadows by default**, but a platform-native elevation cue is acceptable if needed for
  usability or system conventions
- **No toast popups by default**, but system-level confirmations are acceptable when the platform
  depends on them
- **No gradients in UI chrome**, but controlled data-visualization color ramps are acceptable when
  they encode meaning clearly
- **No skeletons by default**; if a product already mandates skeleton loading, simplify it to
  monochrome blocks with minimal visual noise
- **No decorative accent red**; status red is acceptable where the product genuinely needs
  urgent/error signaling

---

## 8. REFERENCE FILES

For detailed token values, component specs, and platform-specific guidance:

- **`references/tokens.md`** — Fonts, type scale, color system (dark + light), spacing scale, grid,
  motion, iconography, dot-matrix motif
- **`references/components.md`** — Cards, buttons, inputs, lists, tables, nav, tags, segmented
  controls, progress bars, charts, widgets, overlays, state patterns
- **`references/platform-mapping.md`** — HTML/CSS, SwiftUI, React/Tailwind, Paper output conventions
- **`references/examples.md`** — Complete response-shape examples, use cases, non-use cases, and
  implementation reminders

---

## 9. WHAT GOOD EXECUTION LOOKS LIKE

A strong Nothing-style response should feel:

- **Confident** — clear hierarchy, no decorative clutter
- **Precise** — exact spacing, exact casing, exact tone
- **Technical** — labels, values, and controls feel instrument-like
- **Restrained** — one expressive moment, not many
- **Actionable** — not just mood, but concrete structure and tokens

If the result looks like generic black minimalism, it failed. If it looks noisy, it also failed. The
target is disciplined tension: sparse, sharp, human.
