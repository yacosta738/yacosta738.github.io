# Deployment Health Checks - T033 Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-16  
**Task:** T033 - Add deployment health checks  
**Status:** âœ… Complete

## Overview

A health check step was added to the deployment workflow (`deploy.yml`) to automatically verify that the site is live and responding with HTTP 200 after deployment to GitHub Pages. This ensures that deployments are validated and any issues are caught immediately.

### Workflow: deploy.yml

- **Job:** deploy-pages
- **Step:** Health Check: Verify site is live
- **Script:**
  - Attempts to access the deployed site up to 5 times (10s intervals)
  - Checks for HTTP 200 response
  - Fails the workflow if the site does not respond with HTTP 200

### Example Step

```yaml
- name: Health Check: Verify site is live
  run: |
    for i in {1..5}; do
      sleep 10
      STATUS=$(curl -s -o /dev/null -w "%{http_code}" "${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }}")
      if [ "$STATUS" = "200" ]; then
        echo "Site is live: ${{ steps.deployment.outputs.page_url }} (HTTP 200)"
        exit 0
      else
        echo "Attempt $i: Site not live yet (HTTP $STATUS)"
      fi
    done
    echo "ERROR: Site did not respond with HTTP 200 after deployment."
    exit 1
```

## Benefits

- **Automated Validation:** Ensures the deployed site is accessible immediately after deployment
- **Early Failure Detection:** Catches deployment issues before users are affected
- **Improved Reliability:** Adds confidence to the deployment process

## Next Steps

- [ ] T034: Document job dependencies
- [ ] T035: Add reliability metrics badges
