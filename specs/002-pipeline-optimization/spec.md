# Feature Specification: Pipeline Optimization

**Feature Branch**: `002-pipeline-optimization`  
**Created**: 2025-10-16  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "pipeline optimization"

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Faster CI/CD Feedback (Priority: P1)

As a developer, I want the CI/CD pipeline to provide feedback on my code changes as quickly as possible, so I can iterate and deliver features or fixes efficiently.

**Why this priority**: Fast feedback is critical for developer productivity and reduces wasted time waiting for builds/tests.

**Independent Test**: Measure the time from push/PR creation to CI feedback; verify it is significantly reduced compared to baseline.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a developer pushes a commit, **When** the pipeline runs, **Then** feedback (pass/fail) is delivered within the optimized target time.
2. **Given** a pull request is opened, **When** the pipeline runs, **Then** the results are available faster than before optimization.

### User Story 2 - Reliable Deployments (Priority: P2)

As a maintainer, I want the pipeline to be more reliable, so deployments are less likely to fail due to pipeline errors rather than code issues.

**Why this priority**: Reliability reduces friction and increases trust in automation, minimizing manual intervention.

**Independent Test**: Track pipeline failure rates due to non-code issues before and after optimization.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a deployment is triggered, **When** the pipeline executes, **Then** it completes successfully unless there is a code or configuration error.

---

### User Story 3 - Cost-Efficient Pipeline Runs (Priority: P3)

As a project owner, I want to reduce unnecessary pipeline runs and resource usage, so operational costs are minimized without sacrificing quality.

**Why this priority**: Cost savings are important for project sustainability, especially for open-source or budget-constrained projects.

**Independent Test**: Compare resource usage and run frequency before and after optimization.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a series of commits, **When** the pipeline is triggered, **Then** redundant or unnecessary jobs are skipped or batched appropriately.

---

### Edge Cases

- What happens if a required job is skipped due to optimization logic?
- How does the system handle external service outages (e.g., CI provider downtime)?
- What if pipeline optimization causes a regression in test coverage or reliability?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: The system MUST reduce average CI/CD pipeline duration by at least 20% compared to the current baseline.
- **FR-002**: The system MUST maintain or improve the current pipeline reliability (no increase in non-code-related failures).
- **FR-003**: The system MUST provide clear reporting on pipeline performance before and after optimization.
- **FR-004**: The system MUST avoid running redundant jobs (e.g., skip jobs for docs-only changes, batch jobs for multiple quick commits).
- **FR-005**: The system MUST allow maintainers to override optimizations when needed (e.g., force full pipeline run).
- **FR-006**: The system MUST ensure that test coverage and quality gates are not reduced by optimization.
- **FR-007**: The system MUST document all optimization strategies and their impact.

### Non-Functional Requirements

- **NFR-001 (Code Quality)**: Code MUST pass Biome lint/format and TypeScript strict type checks (`pnpm check`).
- **NFR-002 (Testing)**: Add or update automated tests appropriate to the change. Bug fixes MUST include a regression test. Frontend P1 journeys MUST have Playwright coverage.
- **NFR-003 (Accessibility & UX)**: Changes MUST maintain keyboard support, visible focus, accurate accessible names, and no navigation regressions.
- **NFR-004 (Performance)**: For web pages, Core Web Vitals targets are LCP ≤ 2.5s, INP ≤ 200ms, CLS < 0.1. For API changes, p95 latency ≤ 200ms under expected load. Provide measurement notes.

### Key Entities

- **Pipeline Job**: Represents a single unit of work in the CI/CD process (e.g., build, test, deploy), with attributes such as duration, status, and dependencies.
- **Pipeline Run**: Represents a full execution of the pipeline, including all jobs, triggers, and outcomes.
- **Optimization Rule**: Represents a condition or logic applied to skip, batch, or modify jobs for efficiency.

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Average CI/CD pipeline duration is reduced by at least 20% over a 1-month period post-optimization.
- **SC-002**: Pipeline reliability (non-code-related failure rate) is maintained or improved.
- **SC-003**: No decrease in test coverage or quality gate pass rates after optimization.
- **SC-004**: Resource usage (e.g., CI minutes, compute cost) is reduced by at least 10% without impacting quality.
- **SC-005**: All required automated tests in CI pass consistently (no new flakiness introduced).
- **SC-006**: Maintainers and developers report improved satisfaction with pipeline speed and reliability (via survey or feedback).

## Assumptions

- The pipeline refers to the main CI/CD process for this repository (build, test, deploy).
- Current baseline metrics are available for comparison.
- Optimization will not compromise code quality or security.
- Standard best practices for pipeline optimization are followed (e.g., caching, parallelization, conditional jobs).
