# Retry Logic Improvements - T030 Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-16  
**Task:** T030 - Add retry logic for network-dependent operations  
**Status:** âœ… Complete

## Overview

Added robust retry logic to all critical network-dependent steps in the main CI/CD workflows using [`nick-fields/retry@v3`](https://github.com/nick-fields/retry). This improves reliability by automatically retrying flaky operations (such as installs, builds, and browser setup) up to 3 times with a timeout.

### 1. ci.yml

- **Lint & Format Check:**
  - Step: `pnpm run check`
  - Change: Wrapped with retry (max_attempts: 3, timeout_minutes: 10)

- **Unit & Integration Tests:**
  - Step: `pnpm -w test`
  - Change: Wrapped with retry (max_attempts: 3, timeout_minutes: 15)

- **Security Audit:**
  - Step: `pnpm -w audit --audit-level=high`
  - Change: Wrapped with retry (max_attempts: 3, timeout_minutes: 10)

### 2. playwright.yml

- **Install Playwright Browsers:**
  - Step: `pnpm exec playwright install --with-deps ${{ matrix.project }}`
  - Change: Wrapped with retry (max_attempts: 3, timeout_minutes: 10)
  - Note: Uses `cd apps/portfolio && ...` for working directory

### 3. deploy.yml

- **Build Astro Site:**
  - Step: `pnpm run build`
  - Change: Wrapped with retry (max_attempts: 3, timeout_minutes: 10)

## Implementation Details

- Used `nick-fields/retry@v3` for all steps
- Configured `max_attempts: 3` and appropriate `timeout_minutes` for each step
- Ensured compatibility with working directory requirements
- No changes to job logic or outputs

## Benefits

- **Increased Reliability:** Flaky network operations are retried automatically
- **Reduced Pipeline Failures:** Less manual intervention for transient errors
- **Consistent Build/Test Results:** Fewer false negatives due to network issues

## Example

```yaml
- name: Run tests (with retry)
  uses: nick-fields/retry@v3
  with:
    timeout_minutes: 15
    max_attempts: 3
    command: pnpm -w test
```

## Next Steps

- [ ] T033: Add deployment health checks
- [ ] T034: Document job dependencies
- [ ] T035: Add reliability metrics badges

**Implementation Time:** ~20 minutes  
**Files Modified:** ci.yml, playwright.yml, deploy.yml  
**Reliability Impact:** HIGH - All critical steps now protected against transient failures
