# Job Dependency Documentation - T034 Implementation

**Date:** 2025-10-16  
**Task:** T034 - Document job dependencies  
**Status:** âœ… Complete

## Overview

Added clear comments to all jobs in the main workflows (`ci.yml` and `deploy.yml`) explaining their dependencies and the rationale for each `needs:` relationship. This improves maintainability and helps contributors understand the pipeline flow.

### ci.yml

- **detect-changes:** No dependencies; runs first to determine which jobs should execute

- **lint:** Depends on `detect-changes` to only run if lint-relevant files changed

- **test:** Depends on `detect-changes` to only run if test-relevant files changed

- **security-audit:** Depends on `detect-changes` to only run if security-relevant files changed

- **collect-metrics:** Depends on all jobs to collect metrics regardless of success/failure

### deploy.yml

- **release:** No dependencies; runs first to create a release

- **build-astro:** Depends on `release` to ensure site is built from the latest release

- **deploy-pages:** Depends on `build-astro` to deploy the freshly built site

- **build-docker:** Depends on `release` to build and push Docker image from the latest release

- **collect-metrics:** Depends on all jobs to collect deployment metrics regardless of success/failure

## Example (ci.yml)

```yaml
jobs:
  lint:
    # Depends on detect-changes to only run if lint-relevant files changed
    needs: detect-changes
    # ...existing code...
```

## Benefits

- **Improved Clarity:** Contributors can quickly understand job relationships
- **Easier Maintenance:** Future changes to job dependencies are easier to audit
- **Onboarding:** New team members can follow pipeline logic with confidence

## Next Steps

- [ ] T035: Add reliability metrics badges

**Implementation Time:** ~10 minutes  
**Files Modified:** ci.yml, deploy.yml  
**Maintainability Impact:** HIGH - Pipeline logic is now fully documented
